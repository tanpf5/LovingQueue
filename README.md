# LovingQueue
This project is a Android Mobile Application which is used to queue.
When you go to some place that need queue, we usually get a number and have to stay there for a long time in case missing our turns. It is very incovenient and a waste of time.
This annoying inconvenience can be perfectly solved by my app. The place which need queue should have a QR code in somewhere like on the wall. If you have my app on your smart phone, you can just scan the QR code, then you are alreadly in the queue. You can go anywhere you want and do anything you like during the queueing time. You can check the queue information like where are you in the queue wherever you are. The app will remind you when your turn is coming. Besides, if you miss the queue accidentally, you can use app to requeue instead of going back for requeueing.
It's very convenient for both the customers and merchants.
